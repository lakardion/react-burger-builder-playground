# Burger Builder

This app was created while doing the course: `React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)` by Maximilian Schwarzmuller

## Development
### Initial install
Run `npm ci` to install the project dependencies
### Json-Server
For development purposes json-server was the chosen option for managing data persistence. 
To run the json server  run `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3004` from `/src` folder

## Description
This app was created with the goal of learning react as well as creating a playground to test new things such as libraries or patterns.

The last deployed version of this app can be found at: https://react-burgertify.web.app/ (latest code does not match latest deploy)

It's been some time since I last deployed this app and there were a few canges in between.
